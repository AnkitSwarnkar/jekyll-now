## Various Blockchain Consesus algorithm

A blockchain is simply a distributed ledger system. Block chain is now a talk of each and every feild. This disruptive technology has created lots of buzz in domains like financial, IOT, academic, assest and many more. Many companies have started leveraging this amazing technology. In this post I will try to summarize the most important part i.e. heart of block chain, the consensus protocol. 

So what is a consesus protocol?
The term ‘consensus’ refers to a decision-making process which is done in a collabrative way. Generally, for centralized architecture there a centrallized machine(node) which takes all the decision however for the block chain, as you know, is a distributive architecture, there need to be a set of rule by which various different computers connected with each other comes to an agreement. More technically, consensus algorithm is required by the blockchain to ensure that every node has a copy of a recognized version of the total ledger.[1] Consensus algorithm allow secure updating of state according to some rules  

Since the inception of PBFT consensus algorithm, there are plethora of consensus algorithms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Concepts in world of blockchain. In this post I will introduce to some of the amazing new consensus protocols.
