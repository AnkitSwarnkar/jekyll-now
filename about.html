I am a "X Men" with superpower of predicting things from huge data! I am a data science graduate student of Indiana University. Currently I am associated with Shoptaki as a Data Science and AI intern. I am also Indiana University <a data science consulting club href="data-science-consulting-club.soic.indiana.edu"/> consultant where we help academic and non-academic clients for their data science problem. I love swimming, playing basketball and adventurous road trip! My dream is to turn my data science passion into superpower!
