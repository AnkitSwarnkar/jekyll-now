## About Me! 
I am the <h2>X Men </h2> with superpower of predicting future from huge data!!
Hi I am data-nerd and a data science graduate student of Indiana University, Bloomington. Currently I am associated with Shoptaki as a Data Science and AI intern. I am also a student consultant of Indiana University <a data science consulting club which is a group of graduate student like me. As a consultant we help academic and non-academic clients for their data science problem and undertake project work. I love swimming, playing basketball and adventurous road trip! 
My dream is to turn my data science passion into a  real superpower with which I can help the world from any future problem!!
