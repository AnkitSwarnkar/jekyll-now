## About Me!

Current Status: Looking for summer intership 2017 in data science domain.

Hi, I am a secret X Men with superpower of predicting future from huge data! I love  turning a dull data to a shocking insight with my data science and computer science skills.  I am a data-nerd and a data science graduate student of Indiana University, Bloomington. 

Currently I am associated with Shoptaki as a Data Science and AI intern where we are cool building a intelligent b2b platform. I am also a student consultant of Indiana University data science consulting club which is a group of graduate student like me. As a consultant, we help academic and non-academic clients for their data science problems and also undertake project work from them. 

I love swimming, playing basketball and adventurous road trip! I like solving puzzles and solving data science is my passion.

My dream is to turn my data science passion into a  real superpower with which I can help the world from any future problem!!
